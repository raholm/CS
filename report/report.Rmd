# Question 1 

## 1.1 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
lottery <- read.csv2("../data/lottery.csv")

head(lottery)

q11 <- ggplot(lottery, aes(x = Day_of_year, y = Draft_No)) + geom_point()
plot(q11)
```

The data looks fairly random although there might be some sort of skewness in the right side of the graph were there are a lacking some observations and therefore having a lower probability of beeing selected.


## 1.2

```{r}
linegraf<- predict(loess(Draft_No ~ Day_of_year, data = lottery))

q12 <- q11 + geom_path(aes(y = linegraf), col = "red")
plot(q12)
```

The fit (line) doesn't seem straight and seems to have a decreasing trend which would support previous statements of people born on a days later on in a year has a lower probability of beeing selected.

## 1.3
